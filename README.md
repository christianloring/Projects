# Projects
First thinkful project where I look an IBM employee survey and tried to determine if there was a difference
in employee satisfaction between genders. The purpose of this was to see if certain conditions may lead to
differing employee retention rates. Minor differences such as men and women having different room temperature
preferences could accumulate and lead into dissatisfaction to cause a low retention rate than what is possible
if extra attention is given to certain details.
